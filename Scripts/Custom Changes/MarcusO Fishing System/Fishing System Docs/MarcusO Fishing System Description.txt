MarcusO's Advanced Fishing System for RunUO 1.0 - February 2007


GOALS:

The goals of this revamped RunUO fishing system are five-fold:

1. To make fishing more fun by adding a variety of experiences. 
2. To make fishing more profitable relative to time invested.
3. To make sea monster loot well-rounded, balanced and complete.
4. To draw more folks to the water, thereby stimulating sea warfare.
5. To not add too much clutter to the ocean (stopping boats).
6. To be an easy upgrade to existing server builds.

I know a lot of folks have added things like new fish and colored
fish steaks, but that's not what needed improving in my humble 
opinion. The level of excitement needed to be bumped up a notch
by adding new monsters and improving loot. That's where this
upgrade is targeted.

FEATURES:

1. Added new fiction-fitting monsters that pop-up while deepwater 
fishing. The monsters are set to pop-up every twenty-or-so fish 
(~5 minutes), and they have loot like UOG Liches. We don't want the
monsters to spawn too often or they would clutter the ocean with 
dead boat-blocking corpses.

2. Added new monsters to pop-up when you get a Net/Map/Sos. No more
will you see the same dull Sea Serpents over and over, though Serps 
still pop-up every once and a while. The new monsters have UOG 
Lich-level loot, because they take about the same effort to kill.
Some of the monsters have decent magic casting abilities. Like
the Sea Serpents, these new monsters can kill you if you are slow.

3. Added some additional fiction-fitting monsters that pop-up while 
you fish for a treasure chest. These are different from the ones
you fought while fishing for MIBs or fish.

4. Added a couple of tamable sea critters. Hopefully this creates a 
new class of Pirate-Tamers :)

5. Added some new fiction-fitting items that can be fished up while
performing regular fishing in deepwater (yes...I made sure you can't
macro on the shore for leet loot). You now have a chance to fish up
a magical item whenever you snag a Big Fish. The items can be very
powerful, but their durability is always low because they've been 
in the water for a long, long time :)

6. Added 30+ new items to fish up while fishing for a chest. The 
list includes chairs, decorative shield & axes, light sources
and other things that are uncommon. I'm guessing it will take
thousands of MIBs and some luck to get one of each of the new
items. Go for it!

7. For the coders out there, I've added a lot of in-line documentation
to my Fishing.cs to help communicate what I think different parts
of the code are doing. I've also highlighted spots where I think
people could easily add new things (or more of what I've done).


INSTALLATION:

Unzip the file and install the new script directory, "/Fishing Monsters", 
in the existing /Scripts/Mobiles/Monsters directory to add 14 new monster 
types:

- 5 are slimes and snakes to be fished up during chest fishing. The snake
is tameable.
- 9 recolored and renamed monsters spawn while normal fishing or during 
Net/Map/SoS harvest

Note that I purposely did not touch the original sea serpents, but I did
use them and modify their templates to make some new cool serpents.

Also included in the Fishing system is a revamped Fishing.cs, which gets
placed in /Scripts/Engines/Harvest. Make sure to backup your existing version
from Fishing.cs to Fishing_cs.old or something, just in case things don't
work for your server build. I hope you appreciate the in-line documentation.


SUMMARY:

The new Fishing.cs expands the fishing experience in multiple dimensions.
The new monsters have increased loot and specific different types of 
reagents, scales, hides so as to enable complete gathering of these types 
of resources on the water, just as they can be gathered on land. No longer 
will you just see the same boring sea serpents...

Most monsters have FireBreath, but it's generally weak because they have
lower hit points than Dragons. Giving the monsters FireBreath makes them
meaner. Some of the buggers poison. The ocean is a dangerous place. But
take heart. None of the monsters are as mean as Land-based Elementals,
unless of course you sail on top of them and they can hit you while
casting spells on you.

I added random color-centered hues to most of the monsters to help fit
their title, or to match the color of the scales they give.

During regular fishing you now have an opportunity to get a magical weapon
or piece of armor in place of the stupid Big Fish. Right now it's set to
a 10% chance to get a magic item in place of the Big Fish. It works out 
one item every few hours so as to be a rare and enjoyable event. 

To decide what extra stuff to randomly fish up while doing MIBs, I searched 
through Pandora's Box to find Items that fit the fiction of fishing while 
working an SoS to fish up a chest. If you are over a sunken ship, you should 
fish up more interesting things than stupid bones etc.

IcebergSnakes and FlameSharks are Tameable!!

I tested each of these creatures individually by creating various test versions
of Fishing.cs that shunted the code to spawn only the creature-under-test 
when a Net/Map/Sos harvest occurred. I also made a version of Fishing.cs that
spawned the monsters way more quickly. It was pretty funny to see a boat 
surrounded by slimes, snakes and other critters. Be forewarned that macro-fishing
will cause you to sail on top of monsters and you will die. Yes, it took 
a long while to test this system, but it seems pretty robust. 

Note that I didn't want to make the monsters too strong, so the elementals 
are weaker cousins from land-based varieties. But at least you get a different
varieties of critters at different times, sometimes carrying a Net/Map/SoS. 
Typically there's never a dull 5 minutes now while you're on the ocean.
The new buggers (even without Net/Map/SoS) pop up while you are just kicking 
back having a beer and fishing.

Enjoy!

Addendum:

Here are the Exact Creature Names. Note that the Admin Tools appear to
be hardcoded, so they don't seem to recognize these in pick lists. So if 
you want to add one, you have to do it manually: [add DeepSeaSnake

new DeepSeaSnake();
new DeepWaterElemental();
new FlameShark();
new GiantWaterStrider();
new HurricaneElemental();
new IcebergElemental();
new IcebergSnake();
new OilSlime();
new RoamingKraken();
new SeaSlime();
new SeaWorm();
new StormSerpent();
new ToxicSlime();
new TsunamiSerpent();
