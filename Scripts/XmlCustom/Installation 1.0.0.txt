This system requires the latest installation of the XmlSpawner2 package (at least version 2.94) if you want to use the client Go/Tracking/Synchronization features or the transfer server. You can find that package here XmlSpawner2

Just unzip the Spawn Editor package (spawneditor2-vxxx.rar and spawneditor2-support.rar) into a folder and run Setup.bat. Then launch the SpawnEditor2.exe executable.

For the client synchronization features just have your client running at the same time. I havent tested this with the 3d client yet.

See the Readme.htm file in the package for more details.

Transfer Server Installation:
1) download the TransferServer-vxxx.rar package.
2) Copy the TransferServer.cs and GetObjectData.cs scripts into your custom scripts area.
3) Place a copy of the transferserver.dll file in your main RunUO installation folder.
4) Add the following lines to your RunUO Data/Assemblies.cfg file

System.Runtime.Remoting.dll
TransferServer.dll

When you restart your server, the Transfer Server will be started by default and you will see a message on the console. You can disable automatic startup by changing the default value of the 'Enabled' property in TransferServer.cs (you can then start it manually with the '[xts start' command).
By default, the Transfer Server will use port 8030 for communication. This can be changed in TransferServer.cs

To start and stop the Transfer Server at any time use the

[xts start
[xts stop

commands.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you are having trouble starting up SpawnEditor2.exe or you receive error messages when you run Setup.bat, you may be missing some needed system dlls (mfc71.dll seems to be a common one). To fix this problem follow these steps:

1)  To find out what required system dlls you might be missing, run the dll dependency walker program 'depends.exe' that can be downloaded at http://www.dependencywalker.com/ and open up the UOMap.ocx from the File menu.


2) Note any missing required dlls that it reports (shown in red).

3) Get the missing dlls and install them in the windows System32 folder. You can probably find the dll that you need at this site http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/
(Dont worry about missing Java dlls since Java support is not required).

4) Run Setup.bat again to install the UOMap.ocx tool.
